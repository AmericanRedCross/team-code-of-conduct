### GIS Team Code of Conduct

#### Overview
*We are a small team aiming to accomplish big things.* 

Team members need to cooperate effectively while also being required at times to operate with a large amount of independence and self-direction. The humanitarian nature of our work can be emotionally difficult and physically taxing, especially during times of disaster response. Cooperation amongst team members is often based on digital communications, and it can be challenging to interpret intent and emotion without face-to-face interaction. There are many challenges to our continued learning, growth, and accomplishments. It is vital that we function effectively together and that we understand what is expected of us as members of the team.

#### Basic guidelines

- Treat everyone with respect.
- Engage in communication with respect and a mindfulness towards basic human decency.
- Assume all communications are positive and people are treating each other with respect. Cues about emotions are often lacking from digital communications. Many of our modes of digital communication tend towards brevity, which can be easier to interpret incorrectly as being negative.
- The team is meant to be a safe environment.
- Feedback is a vital part of maintaining a high quality of output from our team. Always direct focus to the product and not the person. Always be willing to both provide and receive feedback.
- Acknowledge burnout is a very real risk. Never hesitate to let the team know if you need a break.
- Respect basic human decency over the need to accomplish a given task.

#### Encouraged behaviors

- Be friendly and patient.
- Be welcoming.
- Be considerate.
- Be respectful.
- Be careful in your word phrasing and tone.
- Assume all communications are positive.
- When we disagree, try to understand why.

#### Behaviors that won't be tolerated

- Verbal or written abuse.
- Sexist, racist, homophobic behavior (whether subtle or overt, inadvertent or intentional).

#### Process for addressing violations of this code of conduct
- This Code of Conduct is not complete and events/actions that you consider violations may not be explicitly defined in this document. Don't let that deter you from bringing an issue to light.
- If you are comfortable and feel safe doing so, bring it to the attention of the other person.
- Otherwise, or if not resolved, your volunteer supervisor, the team lead (Dale), or the director (Helen), or other appropriate senior leadership (Marian and Jono).
- Also through normal HR procedures.
- Help us improve this Code of Conduct to better identify the problem, submit an edit through a pull request.
